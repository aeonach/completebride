                <p><em>"We got married a week ago today and coming from Northern Ireland I was a bit worried about my makeup because I couldn't have a trial as we arrived the day before the wedding but I needn't have worried at all!! Kirsty arrived at the hotel room promptly at 9:30 my bridesmaid had her makeup done first and it was flawless! I on the other hand never wear makeup so was worried id look to made up but again after much reassurance from Kirsty via messenger we decided on how my makeup would be and I can honestly say I've never felt so pretty or had so many compliments in my life!! I can't recommend complete bridal enough absolutely fantastic artists."</em></p>
